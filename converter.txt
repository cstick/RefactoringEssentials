Converter:

Known limitations and bugs:
- Web UI does not report syntax errors
- Comments are not converted
- Preprocessor directives are not converted

We probably cannot convert all preprocessor directives exactly without changing the semantics.

Missing features Overview:
C# to VB:
1) Namespace level: Done (needs many more tests!)
2) Type level:
  - Constructors/Destructors
  - Automatic Events
  - Custom Events
  - Declare Sub|Function instead of DllImport
  - Handles clause (on members)
  - Implements clause (on members)
3) Statements:
  - everything except:
    * local variable declarations
    * Simple statements/assignments/calls
    * if
    * while
    * do-while
    * using
    * return
    * checked (removed + comment added as it is not supported in VB)
  - most importantly:
    * switch
    * LINQ syntax
    * try with filters
4) Expressions:
  - everything except:
    * literals
    * parentheses
    * prefix/postfix increment/decrement
    * inline assignment is "converted" by adding an __InlineAssignHelper
    * simple invocations
    * member access with . (?. and all others are not supported!)
    * default expr, this, base
    * binary expressions (are we sure we have all operators?)
  - most importantly:
    * object initializers
    * collection initializers
    * async/await
    * yield return/break
    * lambdas and anonymous methods

Tests, Tests, Tests, Tests, ... Tests! ;-)
